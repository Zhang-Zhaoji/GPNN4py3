Readme

We did three different experiments using this framework. 

- Running the original code: you may access them in /original_codes to get slightly changed gpnn codes which can run on python 3.10 + pytorch2, but these codes may use plenty of old torch properties(although, still available). 
- Running the rewrite code: just running main.py, you may have to change the dataset you want to use.
- Running the re-implement code: you can access them in /re-implement folder.

we (will) also provide .ipynb files with 

'!python main.py'

to show you what our terminal show.

My codes were running on dsw-registry-vpc.cn-shanghai.cr.aliyuncs.com/pai/modelscope:1.20.0-pytorch2.4.0-gpu-py310-cu124-ubuntu22.04 and it runs fine to me. If requested, I may create a docker image or share DSW link from Aliyun if possible.

You may also interested in our other parts of codes, which you may request corresponding team member to pull requests or send e-mails to get their codes if needed. I do not own any of their codes, so it would be 

The code document(Chinese Version) could be accessed in code_document_cn.md.
